1. Optimized link via jsdelivr.com [HERE](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Fologan/TypewriterJS@main/TyperwriterSM.js)
2. The Typewriter.js file is the extended version with comments
3. The **example.html** file is an example of good use

## How To Use?
```html
<div id="w2l"><!-- The ID is important so that the JS knows which div to print-->
    <script>//Start the script
        const data = {
            "line-1": "<Fologan>",
            // Write the first text
            "line-2": "Hello World!",
            // Make sure you separate properties with commas
            //Write as many lines as you want
            //Example "line-3": "This is a Demo"
        };
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Fologan/TypewriterJS@main/TyperwriterSM.js"></script>
    <!-- Includes external JavaScript file -->
</div>
